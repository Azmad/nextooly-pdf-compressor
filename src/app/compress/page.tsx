              { q: "Does this PDF compressor upload my file to any server?", a: "No. All compression happens locally in your browser using WebAssembly (WASM). Your file never leaves your device, ensuring 100% privacy." },
              { q: "How does this tool compress a PDF?", a: "We use the MuPDF engine to intelligently reduce the resolution of heavy images and remove unnecessary metadata, while keeping your text sharp and selectable." },
              { q: "What do the compression levels mean?", a: "Recommended = Balanced quality & size. High = Smallest size (lower image quality). Lossless = Cleans metadata without affecting visual quality." },
              { q: "Why is the compression so fast?", a: "Unlike standard JavaScript tools, we use compiled WebAssembly. This allows your browser to run heavy compression tasks at near-native speed." },
              { q: "Why does compression sometimes fail?", a: "Common reasons include password-protected files, corrupted PDFs, or files that are already fully optimized." },
              { q: "Does the compressor change my file name?", a: "Yes, the output is saved as 'compressed.pdf' (or similar) to prevent overwriting your original file by mistake." },
